## To practice and improve my skills in Python, I decided to develop a Text Adventure Game on a book I recently read called "The Lean Startup". 
## The book talks about how to build a successful startup, describing its core components, and how products or services should be developed and launched. 
##I divided the game into 5 steps, and in each, I present a different building block. 

## For reference check out my blog post --> (https://loredonati.org/the-lean-startup)

Too many startups begin with a product idea that they believe people want. They then spend months, if not years,
developing that product without ever showing it to the potential customer, even in its most basic form. 
When they fail to gain widespread client acceptance, it is usually because they never spoke to potential 
customers to establish whether or not the product was appealing. When customers ultimately communicate - 
through their indifference - that they don't care about the idea, the startup fails.\n
